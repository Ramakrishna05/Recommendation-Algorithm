# Recommendation-Algorithm
Item based Recommendation Algorithm with Collaborative Filtering Technique
I have done this project as a part of my undergraduate course. I have used Adjusted Cosine Similarity as main similarity measure and I also used Pearson Correlation and Cosine Similarity to compare my base similarity measure(i.e. Adjusted Cosine). I have implemented K-NN algorithm with varying neighbors(variable k) and also implemented the User based Collaborative Filtering algorithm inorder to compare the results. All the code is written in Matlab.
Feel free to download data and code files and documentation also! Let me know whether my project helped you in anyway!
